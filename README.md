Abstract
<br>
This project, Game Development with AI-Driven Adaptive Difficulty, uses artificial intelligence to create a gaming experience tailored to individual player skills. By leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search, the system dynamically adjusts difficulty based on player performance metrics like reaction time and accuracy. This ensures an engaging, frustration-free experience while keeping players in the optimal "flow state." The project demonstrates the potential of adaptive AI in gaming and beyond, with applications in education, rehabilitation, and training, paving the way for personalized, user-centered game design.
